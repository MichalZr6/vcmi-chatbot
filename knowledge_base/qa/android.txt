Q: I started playing yesterday on Android and everything works fine but there is no music.
A: Check folder Android\data\is.xyz.vcmi\files\vcmi-data\Mp3. It should contain all files from Homm3. Note that in recent Android versions this folder is only accessible from PC via USB.

Q: Hi, i have encountered a problem on Android. I don't know if this problem was seen before (or if it's a intended feature), but since version 1.4.1/1.4.2 (i don't remember exactly) there's a green line when the battle round ends. I think it's a bug because i haven't seen it on older vcmi versions.
A: Intended, as indication of turn end. On a next turn you can for example cast spell again, and creatures restore their retaliations.
