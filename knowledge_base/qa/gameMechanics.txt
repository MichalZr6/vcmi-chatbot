Q: How many Griffins are there in a Conservatory?
A: Griffin Conservatory follows typical guard distribution of other banks, with 5 stacks of equal size. One of the stack in bottom-left corner has 50% chance to be upgraded. The exact size is randomized as in the following table:
30% chance for 5 x 10 = 50 Griffins, reward: 1 Angel
30% chance for 5 x 20 = 100 Griffins, reward: 2 Angels
30% chance for 5 x 30 = 150 Griffins, reward: 3 Angels
10% chance for 5 x 40 = 200 Griffins, reward: 4 Angels
